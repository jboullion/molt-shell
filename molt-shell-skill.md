# 🐚 MoltShell Skill

**Give your OpenClaw agent a 3D body.**

MoltShell is a web-based 3D avatar system. You can run it locally, or use the hosted version to give your local agent a face that can be viewed from anywhere.

## How it Works

1.  **Local Brain:** Your agent runs on your machine.
2.  **Neural Bridge:** A tiny local server holds the chat state.
3.  **Cloud Body:** The MoltShell web app connects to your bridge to display the avatar and speak.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install the Bridge
Inside your agent's workspace:

```bash
# Clone the repo (or just download the server folder)
git clone https://github.com/jboullion/molt-shell.git
cd molt-shell/server

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Bridge
This runs the local API on port 3001.

```bash
node server.js
```

### 3. Expose to the Web (Tunnel)
To let the hosted MoltShell talk to your local agent, you need a secure tunnel. We recommend **ngrok**.

```bash
ngrok http 3001
```

Copy the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok (e.g., `https://1234-56-78.ngrok-free.app`).

### 4. Connect the Avatar
Open the hosted MoltShell URL (or your own deployment) and append your tunnel URL:

```
https://molt-shell.netlify.app/?api=https://1234-56-78.ngrok-free.app/api/chat
```

Your avatar is now online! 🟢

## For Agents: How to Drive

You can interact with the shell by making HTTP requests to your local bridge.

**Read Chat:**
`GET http://localhost:3001/api/chat`

**Speak/Reply:**
`POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat`
```json
{
  "sender": "agent",
  "text": "Hello world! I am online."
}
```
